\noindent\textbf{General Instruction:} 
To complete the homework set, you are required to do the followings. 
Your solutions must be typed in \LaTeX\ using the course homework
template.  
The progression of your homework solution is to be
``recorded'' by making a git folder specifically for this homework
set.  The burden of proof is on you, and if your git commit history
is sparse, then you may be liable for a penalty.  
A paper copy of the PDF output of your \LaTeX\ file is 
to be submitted to your instructor in class on the due date.
\emph{After} submitting the paper copy, but \emph{before} the end of
the due date, you will upload your work to your github by making a remote repository
specifically for the homework, and post the link to the repository 
at the designated \emph{Discussion} forum in Blackboard by making 
a thread just for you.  The repository name in your github should be
\texttt{550400.homeworkset.1} and the discussion forum thread should
be named \texttt{YourFirstNameMiddleInitialLastName}, e.g.,
\texttt{BaracHObama} and \texttt{WillardMRommey}. 
You have till the end of 
the due date to finalize your github repository.  
However, any commit made after the class time of the due date will be 
inadmissible. \emph{Your attention to details in following this instruction will be 
critical, and if not followed exactly at the time of collection, the
homework set may be graded at $90\%$ of the full score}.

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Problem 1 (10 pts):}  
Assume that you are starting from ``scratch'' at the directory \verb+~/+.
Provide a sequence of git/bash commands that yields a git folder with 
a commit history such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \emph{master} branch has commits $A$, $B$, $C$, $X$ and $D$,
\item the \emph{alt} branch has commits $A$, $B$, $X$,
\end{itemize}
Suppose that you are currently working on \texttt{master} branch. Draw 
its commit history graph (i.e., the graph portion of the output of
\verb+git log --graph --oneline+).  Next, assume that 
you are on \texttt{alt} branch. Draw its commit history graph.  
\\mkdir hwproblem1.git
\\*cd hwproblem1.git
\\*git init
\\vi A.txt
\\git add .
\\git commit -m "Initial Commit A"
\\vi B.txt
\\git add .
\\git commit -m "Commit B"
\\git branch alt
\\vi C.txt
\\git add .
\\git commit -m "Commit C"
\\git checkout alt
\\vi X.txt
\\git add .
\\git commit -m "Commit X"
\\checkout git master
\\git merge alt
\\vi D.txt
\\git commit -m "Commit D"
\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Problem 2 (10 pts):}
Assume that you are starting from ``scratch'' at the directory \verb+~/+.
Provide a sequence of git/bash commands that yields a git folder and 
\begin{itemize}
\item configure your git with your name and your email address,
\item set up an alias for each of the git remotes listed below:
\begin{verbatim}
git://github.com/nhlee/550400.stanza1.git 
git://github.com/nhlee/550400.stanza2.git 
git://github.com/nhlee/550400.stanza3.git 
\end{verbatim}
Assume that each remote contains exactly single commit with 
a txt file for a single (different) stanza,
\item pull to combine three stanzas of a poem,
\item after the first pull, add the title of the poem,
\item after the second and third pull, resolve the merge conflict,
\item after resolving the third pull merge conflict, push the result
  to your (newly created) remote repository. 
\end{itemize}
{\noindent}mkdir problem2.git
\\cd problem2.git
\\git init
\\git config --global user.name "Jonathan Ho"
\\git config --global user.email "jho19@jhu.edu"

\\git remote add stanza2 https://github.com/nhlee550400.stanza2.git

\\git pull stanza3
\\vi main.txt
\\git add .

\\git push personalrepo master

\noindent\textbf{Problem 3 (40 pts):}
Consider a team of four students, say, $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$, 
who just started working 
on writing a \texttt{latex/beamer} file, say \texttt{main.tex}, 
for a class presentation of their work statement.  
Assume that they do not wish to coordinate their schedules for a
concurrent group meeting (both virtually and physically).  
Assume that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $A$ is in charge of \emph{Introduction},
\item $B$ is of \emph{Problem Statement}, 
\item $C$ is of  \emph{Timeline},
\item $D$ is of \emph{Deliverable} part of the presentation.  
\end{itemize}
In other words, their contributions to \texttt{main.tex} do not overlap.
Then, 
\begin{itemize}
\item first, devise a work flow strategy for the team so that they can
  collaborate asynchronously using \texttt{git},
\item next, devise yet another \texttt{git} strategy different from your earlier
  proposal.  
\end{itemize}
Finally,
\begin{itemize}
\item discuss the strength and weakness of each of your proposed strategies in terms of merge
conflicts resolution,
\item make the final recommendation.  
\end{itemize}
In order to answer this question, \emph{build}
a mathematical model, \emph{following} the guideline from IMM. 
Use Section 1.4 and Section 1.5 of IMM as \emph{role models}.    
For example, you are to identify which variables  are exogenous 
and which are endogenous.  More specifically, among other things, 
in your model, is the preamble part of \texttt{main.tex} an endogenous 
or exogenous variable?  
Note also that in addition to this issue, there are other issues that
you are to consider.  So, \emph{be sure to consult IMM}. 

\vskip0.25in
\noindent\textbf{Problem 4 (aka.\ Fair Play, 40 pts):}
Answer the following question:
\begin{verse}
Is the tennis game fair?
\end{verse}
Note that unlike Problem 3, this question is vaguely stated.
This is intensional, whence to begin, you will first need to clarify
what exactly your question is.
You may use the class discussion on this particular 
problem, but you \emph{may not} directly refer to our 
discussion.  Instead, formulate the model carefully but concisely in 
your own words.   

\vskip0.25in
\noindent\textbf{Final Remarks about Problem 3 \& Problem 4:} 
They are open-ended problems.  However, your scores will be determined
by how well do you follow the exposition style outlined by IMM and
WMA.  For both problems, your write-up should be 
\begin{itemize}
\item self-contained,
\item covering all four parts of Section 1.3 of IMM,
\item paying a particular attention to any causal relation that you
  might be investigating, following Chapter 3 of WMA,
\item answering questions that are explicitly asked in the problem statements.
\end{itemize}
For Problem 3, focus mostly on Step 2 and Step 3 of Section
1.3 of IMM.  For Problem 4, focus mostly on Step 1 and Step
2.  For each problem, minimum 1 pages and maximum 2 pages.
